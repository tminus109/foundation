Create a simple calculator application which reads parameters from the prompt
and prints the result back to the prompt.
It should support one of the following operators: +, -, *, /, % and two operands.
The format of the input expressions must be: {operator} {operand} {operand}.

Input examples:

"+ 3 3" (the result will be 6)
"* 4 4" (the result will be 16)

To make it work create a method named "calculate()" and use the Scanner class to get input from the user.

The process should work like this:
- Start the program.
- Print: "Please type in the expression:".
- (Wait for the user input).
- After receiving the input print the result number to the prompt.
- Exit the program.
