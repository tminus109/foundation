String quote = "Hofstadter's Law: It you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.";

When saving this quote a disk error has occurred. Please fix it!
Insert the words "always takes longer than" between the words "It" and "you"
using the StringBuilder class.
Use pieces of the quote variable (instead of just redefining the string).
