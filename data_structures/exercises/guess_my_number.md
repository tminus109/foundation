Write a program which first chooses a number between 1 and 100. The player is then asked to enter a guess.
If the player guesses wrong the program gives feedback and asks for new guesses until one is correct.

Make the range customizable (ask for it before starting the guessing).
You can add lives (optional).

Example:

I've a number between 1-100. You have 5 lives.

> 20
Too high. You have 4 lives left.

> 10
Too low. You have 3 lives left.

> 15
Congratulations. You won!
