We are going to represent our contacts in a map where
both the keys and values are strings.

Create a map with the following key-value pairs:

Name (key)	Phone number (value)

William A. Lathan	405-709-1865
John K. Miller	402-247-8568
Hortensia E. Foster	606-481-6467
Amanda D. Newland	319-243-5613
Brooke P. Askew	307-687-2982

Create an application which prints out the answers to the following questions:

What is John K. Miller's phone number?
Whose phone number is 307-687-2982?
Do we know Chris E. Myers' phone number?
