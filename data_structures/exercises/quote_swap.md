List<String> list = Arrays.asList("What", "I", "do", "create,", "I", "cannot", "not", "understand.");

Accidentally I messed up this quote from Richard Feynman.
Two words are out of place.
Your task is to fix it by swapping the right words with code.
To do this, create a method called "swapQuote()".
Also, print the sentence to the output with spaces in between.

Expected output: "What I cannot create I do not understand."
