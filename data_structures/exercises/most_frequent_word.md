Write a function that receives a sentence (string) as a parameter and returns the most frequent word of that sentence.
If there is more than one such word return any one of them.

Test the method with the sentence from John Updike’s 'Rabbit, Run':

But then they were married (she felt awful about being pregnant before but
Harry had been talking about marriage for a while and anyway laughed when
she told him in early February about missing her period and said Great she
was terribly frightened and he said Great and lifted her put his arms around
under her bottom and lifted her like you would a child he could be so
wonderful when you didn’t expect it in a way it seemed important that you
didn’t expect it there was so much nice in him she couldn’t explain to
anybody she had been so frightened about being pregnant and he made her
be proud) they were married after her missing her second period in March
and she was still little clumsy dark-complected Janice Springer and her
husband was a conceited lunk who wasn’t good for anything in the world Daddy
said and the feeling of being alone would melt a little with a little drink.

Expected result: said or little

Bonus: Using a simple split(" ") may produce some incorrect words, e.g. "(she" instead of "she" or "drink." instead of "drink".
Can you fix that?

a (a) a, b b c
Expected result: a
