Create a sum method in your class which has an ArrayList of Integers as parameter.
It should return the sum of the elements in the list.

Follow these steps:

Add a new test case.
Instantiate your class.
Create a list of integers.
Use the assertEquals to test the result of the created sum method.
Run them.

Create different tests where you test your method with:

- an empty list;
- a list that has one element in it,
- a list that has multiple elements in it,
- a null.

Run them. Fix your code if needed.
