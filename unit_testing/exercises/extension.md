There's a work file and a test file.
Run the tests, all 10 should be green (passing).
The implementations though are not quite good.
Create tests that'll fail, and will show how the implementations are wrong
(You can assume that the implementation of join and split are good).
After creating the tests, fix the implementations.
Check again, if you can create failing tests.
