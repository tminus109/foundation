We have bunnies standing in a line numbered as 1, 2, ...
The "odd" bunnies (1, 3, ...) have the usual number of ears = 2.
However, the even bunnies (2, 4, ...) only have 1 ear each.
Write a recursive method which accepts the number of bunnies as a parameter
and returns the total number of "ears" in the bunny line.
The method should be able to handle invalid input (e.g. negative numbers).
