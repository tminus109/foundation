Create a function called maxSum which expects an array of five integers as an input parameter
and returns the maximum values that can be calculated by
summing exactly four of the five integers.

Examples:

[1 2 3 4 5] -> 14

We can calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12
1 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 13
2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14
