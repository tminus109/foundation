Add creating function

Work on the same project.
Extend the project and add view and methods for creating new Todos.
You will need two different methods (GET, POST) in controller.
The view should be a simple form, which should receive the new object
and if the template is right, create the needed object for us.
Hint: google "handling form submission spring/asp.net core".
Save the passed object in your controller's method which handles the POST request,
using the repository.
After the user submitted the form and the Todo is saved, redirect to the list page.
Add a link to the list page which redirects to the add todo page.
