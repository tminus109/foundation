Create a two-dimensional array dynamically with the following content.
Note that a two-dimensional array is often called matrix if every internal array has the same length. Use a loop!

1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

Its length should depend on a variable.
Print this two-dimensional array to the output.
