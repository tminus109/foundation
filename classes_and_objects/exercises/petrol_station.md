Create Station and Car classes.

Station:

It stores how much gas is available: gasAmount
It can refill a car: refill(car): decreases the gasAmount and increases the car's gasAmount.

Car:

It stores how much gas is actually present: gasAmount
It stores the capacity of the tank: capacity

Create a constructor for the Car class where you:
- initialize gasAmount -> 0
- initialize capacity -> 100
