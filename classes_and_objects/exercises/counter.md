Create Counter class which has a counter (integer) field - 
at creation it should have a default value 0.

There are two ways to create the class:
- with 0 input parameters,
- with 1 input parameter called counter which is set as the initial value of the counter field.

We can add another whole number to this counter: add(number).
We can just increase the counter's value by one: add() (no parameters).
We can get() the current counter value.
We can reset() the counter to the initial value, set during the construction of the class.

Download CounterTest.java and place it next to your solution.
Check if everything works fine with the proper tests.
Other hints for running:
If something gets red (OSX): press ⌥⏎ and add JUnit5 to classpath (5 aka JUnit FIVE not 4 or 3).
Run the tests one by one with the green play button before the method name
(or run all of them by pressing the button before the classname).
