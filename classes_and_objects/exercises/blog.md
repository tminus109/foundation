Reuse your BlogPost class.

Create a Blog class which can store a list of BlogPosts and has the following methods:

- add(BlogPost) -> adds a BlogPost to the list,
- delete(int) -> deletes the BlogPost from the given index,
- update(int, BlogPost) -> replaces an item at the given index with a new BlogPost.
