Reuse your Animal class.
Create a Farm class.

It has a list of Animals (listOfAnimals).
It has a limit that defines how many animals can be kept in the Farm
and can be set when the Farm is created.

Tt has two methods:
breed() -> creates a new animal if there's place for it.
sell() -> removes the least hungry animal.
