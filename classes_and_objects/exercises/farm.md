Reuse your farm.Animal class.
Create a farm.Farm class.

It has a list of Animals (listOfAnimals).
It has a limit that defines how many animals can be kept in the farm.Farm
and can be set when the farm.Farm is created.

Tt has two methods:
breed() -> creates a new animal if there's place for it.
sell() -> removes the least hungry animal.
