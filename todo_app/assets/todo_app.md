When the application is run with -l argument.

And it should add numbers before each.

And the file where you store your data.
And the file has less than 20 tasks.
When the application is run with the -r 20 argument.
Then it should show an error message like: Unable to remove - index is out of bound.

When the application is run with the -r apple argument.
Then it should show an error message like: Unable to remove - index is not a number.


Argument error handling:

Given the terminal opened in the project directory.
When the application is run with an unsupported argument (e.g.: get).
Then it should show an error message like: Unsupported argument.
And it should print the usage information.


Check task:

Given the terminal opened in the project directory.
And the file where you store your data.
And the file has at least 2 tasks.
When the application is run with the -c 2 argument.
Then it should check the second task from the file.


Print all tasks:

Given the terminal opened in the project directory.
And an undone task with the description Walk the dog stored in the file.
And a done task with the description Buy milk stored in the file.
