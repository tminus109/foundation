An anagram is a direct word switch or word play,
the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase,
using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram.

Create a function named isAnagram() following your current language's style guide.
It should take two strings and return a boolean value depending on whether it's an anagram or not.

Examples:

input 1	input 2	output
"dog"	"god"	true
"green"	"fox"	false
