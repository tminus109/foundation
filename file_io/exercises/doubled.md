Create a method called decryptDoubled() that takes a filename as string as a parameter,
and it can decrypt the duplicated-chars.txt file.
Decryption is the process reversing an encryption, i.e. the process
which converts encrypted data into its original form.
If the file can't be opened it should return this message: File not found.
The result should be saved in the output.txt file.
