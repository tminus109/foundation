The file contains an ended Tic-Tac-Toe match.
We have provided you some example files (draw.txt, win_x.txt, win_o.txt).
Return "X", "O" or "Draw" based on the input file's content.

System.out.println(ticTacResult("win_o.txt"));
Should print "O".

System.out.println(ticTacResult("win_x.txt"));
Should print "X".

System.out.println(ticTacResult("draw.txt"));
