Create a function that  takes the name of a CSV file as a parameter.
Every row is in the following format: <person name>;<birthdate in YYYY-MM-DD format>;<city name>
Return the year when the most births happened.
If there were multiple years with the same number of births then return any of them.
You can find such a CSV file in this directory named births.csv
If you pass "births.csv" to your function, the result should be either 2006 or 2016.
